# HarvardX-CS50 - Currency
I only wrote down the "currency project" from the course, because the others example were very basic and i didn't saw a point to include them here.<br/>
I just included this one, to give a example of a API usage with fetch, even though i also consider it to be very basic.<br/><br/>

I improved just a tiny bit on the example given at the course.<br/>
