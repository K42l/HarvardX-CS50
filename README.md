 CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Lessons from the course (on going)

I'm not downloading the source codes from the lessons. I'm currently taking the course and writing down the projects and apps that I find interesting, and I think it would be a good addition to my GitHub.
I intend to compile all of them into one project later on, using Django and React, so I can practice and develop my skills.Â
